## Implementations

### Changes requested by our supervisor
- **Add some validation on the login/signup**: At the beginning of our app the user just had to put in their detail in this an email and password but after our meeting with our supervisor on the 5th of september, He suggested that we coudld have some validation for our password, like having special characters in our pasword also the having a specific length for the password. On top that we added a toast that pops everytime the user's password doesn't satisfy the requirements.
- **Add a hello {username} feature**: Every user has their name and email stored in the database such everytime when they log in to our system, on the profile page their usename printed out.Like the image below.

- **Add a profile page**: The image above is the implemented profile page on our system, shows you booked vehicles, it has it's own kudubucks system.
- **Add a change password feature on the Profile page**: Below is an image that kind of shows how a user can change their password on the profile page, they click the "change password link" and a pop up will show up, and they can either cancel or change their password.
