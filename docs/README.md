## Introductionüëã
The Campus Navigation and Transportation App is designed to improve mobility and accessibility on campus through interactive maps, real-time GPS tracking, and optimized routing for both indoor and outdoor navigation. It seamlessly integrates transportation schedules and includes rental services for bikes, scooters, and skateboards, with features to easily locate and check availability at nearby rental stations. As an added feature, the app offers accessibility-friendly routes for individuals with disabilities, ensuring a smooth, user-friendly experience for navigation, scheduling, and rental management. The app is powered by robust APIs that efficiently handle map data, transportation tracking, and rental services, backed by secure server and database infrastructure capable of managing real-time data traffic.
