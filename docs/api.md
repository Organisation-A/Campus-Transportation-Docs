## Implementation

### Using the Emergency Alert API

We have decided to implement a popup feature that will appear during emergency situations, displaying the time of the emergency and relevant information. This popup will prevent the user from interacting with any other features of the app until they acknowledge the alert and take the necessary steps to evacuate the premises.
